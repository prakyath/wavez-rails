    # logging Union Station information about this request. This method should

    # has begun. Only after calling this method will it be possible to log
    # request-specific information to Union Station.

    #
    # Various API methods expect you to provide timing information. They
    # accept standard Ruby `Time` objects, but it is generally better to
    # pass `TimePoint` objects. Unlike the standard Ruby `Time` object,
    # which only contains the wall clock time (the real time), `TimePoint`
    # may contain additional timing information such as CPU time, time
    # spent in userspace and kernel space, time spent context switching,
    # etc. The exact information contained in the object is operating
    # system specific, hence why the object is meant to be opaque.
    #
    # See {RequestReporter#log_controller_action} for an example of
    # an API method which expects timing information.
    # `RequestReporter#log_controller_action` expects you to
    # provide timing information about a controller action. That timing
    # information is supposed to be obtained by calling
    # `UnionStationHooks.now`.
    #
    # In all API methods that expect a `TimePoint`, you can also pass a
    # normal Ruby `Time` object instead. But if you do that, the logged
    # timing information will be less detailed. Only do this if you cannot
    # obtain a `TimePoint` object for some reason.
