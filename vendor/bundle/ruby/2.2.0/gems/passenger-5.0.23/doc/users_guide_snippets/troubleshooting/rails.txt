==== The Rails application's log file is not being written to

There are a couple things that you should be aware of:

- By default, Phusion Passenger runs Rails applications in 'production' mode,
  so please be sure to check `production.log` instead of `development.log`.
+
See
ifdef::apache[]
<<RailsEnv,RailsEnv>>
endif::[]
ifdef::nginx[]
<<RailsEnv,rails_env>>
endif::[]
for configuration.
- By default, Phusion Passenger runs Rails applications as the owner of `config.ru`.
  So the log file can only be written to if that user has write permission to the
  log file. Please `chmod` or `chown` your log file accordingly.
+
See <<User_switching,User switching (security)>> for details.

If you're using a RedHat-derived Linux distribution (such as Fedora or CentOS)
then it is link:http://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=4[possible
that SELinux is interfering]. RedHat's SELinux policy only allows Apache to read/write
directories that have the 'httpd_sys_content_t' security context. Please run the
following command to give your Rails application folder that context:

-----------------------------------------------------------
chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/your/rails/app
-----------------------------------------------------------
