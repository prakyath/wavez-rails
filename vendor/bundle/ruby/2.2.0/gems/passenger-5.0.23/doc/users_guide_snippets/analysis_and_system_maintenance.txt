=== Debugging frozen applications ===

If one of your application processes is frozen (stopped responding), then you
can figure out where it is frozen by killing it with 'SIGABRT'. This will cause the
processs to print a backtrace, after which it aborts. The backtrace information is
logged into the web server error log file.

In case of Ruby applications, you can also send the 'SIGQUIT' signal to have it print
a backtrace without aborting.
